On behalf of the Executive Committee and all of our members I welcome you to our website. Your access to educational opportunities and networking is our top priority. We have utilized many tools including Facebook Live via our Facebook and a YouTube Channel to give our members access to education. We are geographically challenged and we've planned our events with you in mind!

The Chapter holds routine elections and offers many opportunities for executive leadership and local involvement in IAAO activities.
